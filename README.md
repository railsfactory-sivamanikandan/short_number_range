# ShortNumberRange

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/short_number_range`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'short_number_range'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install short_number_range

## Usage

```ruby
 require 'short_number_range'
 include ShortNumberRange

 "1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10".convert_range # "1 - 5, 7, 9 - 10"
 "1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10".convert_range({short_string: 'to'}) # "1 to 5, 7, 9 to 10"
 "1-2-3-4-5-7-9-10".convert_range({short_string: 'to', delimiter: '-'}) # "1 to 5, 7, 9 to 10"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
